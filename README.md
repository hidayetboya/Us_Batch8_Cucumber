Tabii, proje hakkında biraz daha detay vererek anlamlı bir README hazırlayabiliriz. Bu tür projelerde genellikle "Country" ve "Citizenship" gibi özellikler, bir ülkenin vatandaşlık başvuru süreçlerini ya da kullanıcıların ülke bazında işlem yapmalarını test eden senaryolar olabilir. Bu tür testlerin otomasyonunu gerçekleştiren bir framework oluşturulmuş gibi görünüyor.

İşte projeye özel, anlamlı ve açıklayıcı bir README örneği:

# Us\_Batch8\_Cucumber

This project is an **automation testing framework** designed to test **country-related** and **citizenship** functionalities within an application. It is built using the **Cucumber** framework and written in **Java**. The project uses **Gherkin** language for defining feature files and test scenarios to automate real-world workflows.

The purpose of this project is to validate various user workflows, such as applying for citizenship in different countries, and ensure that the application's features work seamlessly.

## Contents

* **StepDefinitions**: Contains step definitions used to implement the test scenarios.
* **FeatureFiles**: Contains the Gherkin feature files that describe the test scenarios related to country and citizenship processes.
* **Pages**: Contains the Java classes that simulate different pages of the application (e.g., forms for applying for citizenship, selecting countries, etc.).
* **Utilities**: Helper classes to support test automation processes.

## Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to automate **end-to-end testing** of the country's citizenship application and related processes. Test scenarios like country selection, citizenship application, and user validation are defined in the feature files.

### Key Features of the Project:

* **Country Selection**: Tests the functionality of selecting a country from a dropdown or list.
* **Citizenship Application**: Automates the steps involved in applying for citizenship in a selected country.
* **Scenario-based Testing**: Test various scenarios like valid and invalid citizenship applications, different country processes, etc.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine to run the project:

* **Git**: Version control tool to clone the repository.
* **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Java must be installed to run the project.

   After running the tests, the results will be available in the `target` folder.

## Project Structure

* **src/main/java**: Contains the source code files for the project.

  * **org/example**: Contains classes related to test step definitions and implementation.
  * **Pages**: Contains Java classes for simulating user interactions on different pages of the application (e.g., citizenship application form).
* **src/test/java**: Contains the test classes and step definitions for test automation.

  * **StepDefinitions**: Defines the steps for running the test cases.
  * **FeatureFiles**: Contains Gherkin-based feature files describing the test scenarios for different functionalities (e.g., citizenship application process).

## Example Scenarios

### Feature: Country Selection

```gherkin
Feature: Country selection functionality

  Scenario: Select a country from the dropdown
    Given I am on the country selection page
    When I select a country from the dropdown
    Then the country should be displayed in the selected country field
```

### Feature: Citizenship Application

```gherkin
Feature: Citizenship application process

  Scenario: Apply for citizenship with valid details
    Given I am on the citizenship application page
    When I fill in the application form with valid details
    Then I should be able to submit the application successfully
    And I should receive a confirmation message
```
